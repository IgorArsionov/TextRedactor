Richard, I want to swing with you... and surrender completely to your hands.
My arms are gently bound behind my back with leather cuffs, my legs are spread wide and fastened to stirrups. My body sways in the air, my open chest heaving with anticipation, my nippples tense, and the space between my thighs is already wet and hot.
You approach slowly, running your fingers along my inner thigh, teasing, barely touching my entrance. I quietly breathe out your name, arching into your embrace. You smile, lean in, and kiss me there long and tenderly, circling my clitoris with your tongue until I begin to tremble and beg.
Then you enter smoothly, inch by inch, feeling me grip you tightly and passionately. The swing begins to rock from your thrusts, slowly at first, deeply, each time a little harder, until I moan louder, until my body gives in to you.
You hold my hips, control the rhythm, spank my butt, tug at my nippples,, and I'm completely at your mercy, coming in waves, clenching around you, screaming into the empty room. You continue until you spill inside me, hot and long, filling me to the brim.
I want to feel it... tie me up and take me beautifully, slowly, until I shiver. 😈 Do you like my idea? What do you think about it? I'll say no, I'm really looking forward to it.
