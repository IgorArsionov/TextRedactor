Manny, I think about you and smile...
I want to come up to you quietly, sit face to face, spread my thighs, and press my whole body against you. Feel how you instantly harden beneath me, pressing right into where I'm already wet.
I begin to rock slowly—back and forth, rubbing against your hardness through the fabric. My hands are on your shoulders, my lips are next to your ear, whispering, "I want you so much here and now."
I stroke your neck, kiss the corner of your mouth, and my hips continue to tease you—sometimes almost letting go, sometimes pressing harder, until you start moaning softly and grabbing my waist.
I want to see your eyes when you're on the edge and already want me.
I'm already covered in goosebumps from thinking about you.
Will you write me a letter? Your break is over, and I was so hoping to hear from you.
